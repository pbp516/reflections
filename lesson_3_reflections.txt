When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

  A remote repository is useful when collaborting with others on a project. Also 
  if you want to ensure that files are properly backed up on githubs servers, it 
  is useful to maintain a repository on their servers. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay-up-to date with your remote repository?

	You might be working on a collaborative project where another user's
	push into the github repository changes the file your working. This 
	could be hazardous to the state of the project. So the best approach is to manually push/pull the files so you know exactly what state of the project your working with. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use onf instead of another?

	A branch is a separate path taken within the repository by which
	changes can be added without affecting the main master branch.
	A clone is a whole copy of the respository that should be used when
	you want to take a project from github or a local source.
	A fork is a copy made on githubs servers that is useful when you want to have your version of a project as a remote that can be easily accessed and altered on your local system and github itself
